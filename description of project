🚀 **Sentiment Classification with NLP and Machine Learning** 🌟  

Thrilled to share my latest project exploring **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning models** for sentiment classification! This work combines cutting-edge feature extraction methods, advanced oversampling techniques, and robust algorithms to classify sentiments with high accuracy. 🧑‍💻✨  

---

## **Highlights of the Project**  

📚 **Feature Extraction Techniques:**  
1️⃣ **Bag of Words (BoW):** Representing text as word occurrence vectors.  
2️⃣ **TF-IDF:** Highlighting significant words by combining term frequency with inverse document frequency.  
3️⃣ **Word2Vec:** Learning semantic relationships to create dense word embeddings.  
4️⃣ **GloVe (Global Vectors):** Leveraging pre-trained word vectors to capture global word co-occurrences.  

⚖️ **Class Imbalance Handling with SMOTE:**  
- **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** was used to balance the dataset, improving model performance on underrepresented classes.  

💻 **Machine Learning Models Evaluated:**  
- **Naive Bayes**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**  

---

## **Key Results and Insights**  

### **XGBoost Performance**  
🏆 **TF-IDF + SMOTE + XGBoost** achieved the best results:  
- **Accuracy:** **92.71%**  
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** **0.93**  
- **ROC-AUC:** **0.98**  

This combination effectively captured the nuances of sentiment classification, demonstrating the strength of **TF-IDF** for feature representation when paired with SMOTE and XGBoost.  

### **GloVe + SMOTE with XGBoost**  
While **GloVe embeddings** showed promise, achieving an accuracy of **87.51%**, they highlighted limitations in capturing nuanced sentiment for the underrepresented class.  

---

## **Evaluation Metrics**  
Results were assessed using:  
✅ **Accuracy**  
✅ **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**  
✅ **ROC-AUC Curve** (AUC = 0.98)

## **Future Work**  

🔍 Explore **Deep Learning Models** like **BERT** to improve semantic understanding.  
🌐 Investigate techniques such as **SHAP** and **LIME** for better model interpretability.  
📈 Experiment with additional embeddings and NLP techniques to refine performance further.
